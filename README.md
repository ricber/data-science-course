# Practical Data Science Course Lessons

This is the teaching material that I use for laboratory lessons on practical data science for the following courses:
*   Data Analytics for Smart Agriculture (I semester, Politecnico di Milano, Milan campus)
*   Data Harvesting and Data Analysis for Agriculture (II semester, Politecnico di Milano, Cremona campus)
