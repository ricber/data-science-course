# Practical Data Science Lessons

This the teaching material that I use for laboratory lessons on practical data science applied to agriculture for the following courses:
*   Data Analytics for Smart Agriculture (I semester, Politecnico di Milano, Milan campus)
*   Data Harvesting and Data Analysis for Agriculture (II semester, Politecnico di Milano, Cremona campus)

**Within each directory, you will find a theory notebook that is extensively commented on the respective lesson topic, along with a homework directory containing exercises and their solutions. The comprehensive index of course topics is provided below.**
