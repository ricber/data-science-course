We'll be using several transformers that learn a transformation on the training data and then apply that transformation on future data. On these (more typical) transformers it makes sense to have a `.fit()` and a separate `.transform()`. With PolynomialFeatures, the `.fit()` is pretty trivial, and we often fit and transform in one command, as seen above.\n",
